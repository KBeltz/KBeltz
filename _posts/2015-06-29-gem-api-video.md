Tonight I did a video on an API/gem integration. It was supposed to be a somewhat generic how-to video using my project as an example. I am terrible at videos - I never feel like I know what to say because I am always over-thinking and second-guessing myself right up until the very second that the words come spilling (slowly...oh so very slowly!) out of my mouth. I am going to keep putting videos out there anyway (and probably complaining about it) because the more I do it, the more confident I will become and eventually I will be able to fool people into thinking I know what I am talking about! Seriously, though, it reminds me a little bit of a slightly-less-intimidating version of the "boards" we had to do in naval nuclear prototype. We had to learn specific things about the reactor plant or some electrical system, and then instead of putting keyword vomit onto a test paper, we had to actually get up in front of our instructors and prove that we knew what we were talking about. This isn't quite so terrifying, but it feels similar. I understand that it is important to be able to talk to people about this stuff, so I am determined to become more comfortable with it.
