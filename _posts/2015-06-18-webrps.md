We went over HTML in class today. Our assignment was to create a [rock paper scissors](http://priest-peggy-45123.bitballoon.com) game strictly in HTML. It was a fun little project, but I wanted to do a little bit more with it. I ended up also making a [rock paper scissors lizard spock](http://lizard-spock.bitballoon.com) game for fun. I used an image mapping tool to create the links on one of the images, which I thought was pretty cool.
