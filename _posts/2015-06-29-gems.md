Today I managed to integrate a gem into my sinatra web project. Sumeet showed me a gem called HTTParty, which I used to convert the json output into ruby hash format. From there I just had to use pry to navigate this huge nested hash-array monstrosity to pick out the information that I wanted. I am so pumped! I will post a more technical blurb about this project later in the week, but right now I have work to do!
