###Assignment
Answer the following questions: 

* What is an ORM?
* How does your ORM help you get all of a particular table's rows from the database?
* How does your ORM represent rows from a table, given that Ruby doesn't have a Table data structure?
* How does your ORM convert rows from a table into the Ruby data structure (which you identified in the previous question)?

###What is an ORM
ORM is an Object Relational Model. It is a way to integrate a database with an object-oriented program. In other words, it is a way to facilitate a relationship between the databases I create in SQL with the programs I write in Ruby.

To get all of a particular table's rows from the database I use a method (all) from my DatabaseClassMethods class. 

```ruby

  # Get all of the rows for a table.
  #
  # Returns an Array containing Hashes for each row.
  def all
    # Figure out the table's name from the class we're calling the method on.
    table_name = self.to_s.pluralize.underscore
    
    results = DATABASE.execute("SELECT * FROM #{table_name}")
 
    results_as_objects = []
    
    results.each do |result_hash|
      results_as_objects << self.new(result_hash)
    end
    
    return results_as_objects
  end
````
