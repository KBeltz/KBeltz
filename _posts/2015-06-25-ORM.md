###Assignment
Answer the following questions: 

* What is an ORM?
* How does your ORM help you get all of a particular table's rows from the database?
* How does your ORM represent rows from a table, given that Ruby doesn't have a Table data structure?
* How does your ORM convert rows from a table into the Ruby data structure (which you identified in the previous question)?

###What is an ORM
ORM is an Object Relational Model. It is a way to integrate a database with an object-oriented program. In other words, it is a way to facilitate a relationship between the databases I create in SQL with the programs I write in Ruby.

To get all of a particular table's rows from the database I use a method (all) from my DatabaseClassMethods class. 

```ruby

  # Get all of the rows for a table.
  #
  # Returns an Array containing Hashes for each row.
  def all
    # Figure out the table's name from the class we're calling the method on.
    table_name = self.to_s.pluralize.underscore
    
    results = DATABASE.execute("SELECT * FROM #{table_name}")
 
    results_as_objects = []
    
    results.each do |result_hash|
      results_as_objects << self.new(result_hash)
    end
    
    return results_as_objects
  end  
  
````
When the method is called, table\_name is determined by retrieving self, which is the name of the class that calls the all method. For example, Cyclist.all will return Cyclist. #to_s will convert Cyclist into a string. Pluralize will do as you would expect, and converts "Cyclist" into "Cyclists." The underscore method will separate words with an underscore, if necessary, as well as converting it to downcase which leaves table\_name = "cyclists."

```ruby

table_name = self.to_s.pluralize.underscore

```

```ruby

results = DATABASE.execute("SELECT * FROM #{table_name}")

```
