This weekend we were required to choose from a list of available topics and record a video explaining part of our current program. I hate making videos. 

My program is a database to store cyclists, the bikes they own, and their bike rides. The user can create/read/update/delete items in all three fields. There is also a feature to select a single cyclist and look at a list of the bike(s) he or she owns. I chose to explain a SQL join I used to accomplish this.
